# Two separate models have been implemented:
" main.py with rail.pt"  – Detects humans and vehicles using rectangles.
" mainTwo.py with rail3.pt "– Detects railway tracks and overhead electric poles using segmentation (polygons).

Adjusted label placement so that text for Overhead-Electric-Poles appears at the bottom of the polygon.

Assigned different polygon colors for each detected class for better visibility.
